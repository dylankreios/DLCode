## Some codes in learning deeplearning

1. Single variable linear regression
2. Multivariate linear regression
3. Binary classification
4. Analog logic gates

**Note**:

1. In all the codes, I only went to the parameter part of the final training, without further prediction
2. In the `helper` folder are some auxiliary functions and network classes

**How to run**

```python
python xxx.py
```
